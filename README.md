# COMP1020 Laboratory #4

##Lab 4 Instructions
###Lab Goals

The goal of this lab is to:

Get setup on GitHub
Create a repository on GitHub using the course classroom account 
Connect a PyCharm project to a GitHub repo
Practice making changes and synchronizing with the GitHub repo.
Getting Started on GitHub
You will need a GitHub account for this lab and for the next assignment. If you have an account, go to GitHub and sign in. Otherwise, follow the directions below to create an account. 

Go to https://github.com/Links to an external site..
Click the Sign Up button in the upper right.
Enter an email. This may be an account you use in the future (for example, with some future capstone project), so think carefully about which email to choose.
Create a password (or let a password manager create one for you). If you are on a lab machine, do something to create a record of your email and password so you can login from a different device.
Create a username. It can be fun and interesting, but you may use this in the future to publicize projects to potential employers so choose carefully.
Accept or reject emails and Continue.
Verify by clicking on the Verify button. Solve a Captcha.
Create the account and get the code from your email. 
You are then asked to describe yourself. I chose Student with an interest in Collaborative Coding.

You should choose the free plan for now. There is an option to apply for student benefits and I strongly recommend that at some point in the future, but we don't want to go through a verification process now.

Work with those around you to help them or ask for help if you are stuck.

Form a Team
Form a small team of two or three people in the lab. Everyone needs to be on a team (your grade will not depend on this team, and it's only for the next half-hour, so don't stress about who you partner with!).
